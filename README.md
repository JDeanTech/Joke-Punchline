# Joke-Punchline
This repository opens the joke file and reads entire file. This is the joke.

Then opens the punchline file and moves to end of file and reads the last line before the end. This is the punchline.

# What I Learned
Open/Close files.

If files do not open.

Read entire file content.

Move positions in a file.

Read previous line to the position.
